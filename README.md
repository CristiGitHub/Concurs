Tomcat Web Application 
This is a Web Application made by me where i used java hibernate apache tomcat and more
Disclaimer: Some of the front end code is not made by me ( i am not into front end) 
if you want to reuse this app you will need a mysql db and apache tomcat realm for login/register
i will try to update this app by adding WebSockets and maybe Spring (idk yet)
i hope some of this code will be usefull 
Good luck ;)
